### App Overview

**This project is a frontend built for the purpose of accessing data via a backend I created which hosts article, user and comment data. The intention here is to display the contents clearly and concise similar to how Reddit does.**

To run this project locally you are required to have downloaded and a minimum version of
- `Node.js V14`

## How to use the app?

You can access this app on the hosted version above. You will be taken to the main page which displays all available articles. There is functionality to sort the articles by four metrics and to also order the content displayed in ascending or descending order by those metrics. By default it is sorted via article creation date and descending. You can click on an image or title to be taken to the articles individual page where you can read the content of the article and comments linked to it.

There you can write comments (providing you use a valid username) or Log In by clicking on the Users bar in the Navigation. When logged in you are also able to delete comments providing the author of the comment is consistent with the logged in user. 

Finally there is also a Topics page in the navigation which displays all available Topics, clicking one of these will filter all articles and only display those with the chosen topic selected.
